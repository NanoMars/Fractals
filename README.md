This project used ai to aid in the creation of the code, & with some math things I couldn't quite figure out.

Draws fractals in python on a page that can be scaled and moved. The highlight of this is the camera class which allows for movement and scaling of the viewport to inspect the fractals. This was made for Hack Club Arcade
